# ImageTokenizer: Unified Image and Video Tokenization

Welcome to the **ImageTokenizer** repository! 🎉 This Python package is designed to simplify the process of image and video tokenization, a crucial step for various applications such as image/video generation and understanding. We provide a variety of popular tokenizers with a simple and unified interface, making your coding experience seamless and efficient. 🛠️

> ⚠️💡 Note that this project is still in its early stages of development. We welcome any contributions from the community to help us improve and expand the package. Please make sure **star** and **fork** the repository if you find it useful. We are tacking on some awesome applications with `imagetokenizer` such as image/video generation and understanding. Stay tuned!


## Features

- **Unified Interface**: A consistent API for all supported tokenizers.
- **Extensive Support**: Covers a range of popular image and video tokenizers.
- **Easy Integration**: Quick setup and integration with your projects.
- **Different ImageTokenizers**: Support Magvit2, OmniTokenizer, Titok etc.


## Updates

- 🔥**2024.06.22**: Titok were supported now! **This most minimal tokens num tokenizer as for now**;
- 🔥**2024.06.22**: OmniTokenizer supported now!


## Supported Tokenizers

Here's a list of the current supported image tokenizers:

- **OmniTokenizer**: Versatile tokenizer capable of handling both images and videos.
- **OpenMagvit2**: An open-source version of Magvit2, renowned for its excellent results.

## Getting Started

To get started with ImageTokenizer, follow these simple steps:

### Installation

You can install ImageTokenizer using pip:

```bash
pip install imagetokenizer
```

### Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use OmniTokenizer:

```python
from imagetokenizer import Magvit2Tokenizer

# Initialize the tokenizer
image_tokenizer = Magvit2Tokenizer()

# Tokenize an image
quants, embedding, codebook_indices = image_tokenizer.encode("path_to_your_image.jpg")

# Print the tokens
print(image_tokens)

image = image_tokenizer.decode(quants)
```
